# Eyes Exercise
This is an exercise that brings together skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here we bind the actions of the user to the DOM throught the events of the mouse. 

# Explanation
This project is a result of an assignment provided by MIT XPro. This assignment practices fundamental HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills making use of:
- CSS styling by classes
- Coding logic to manipulate items in the DOM through event listeners

# Roadmap for Future Improvements
To elaborate on this project I would like to introduce an element styled to look like a bird that replace the mouse pointer and be the subject for the eyes to follow. I would also like to animate the eyes to blink after a certain number of  mouse movements and open or close upon mouse a click.
